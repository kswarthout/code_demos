# Project Cost Desktop Report Integration
Below you can see images of the BI report integration I built for Microsoft Dynamics GP. The app is a SQL reporting utility that integrates with Microsoft Dynamics GP using Project Cost. The reports are created using DevExpress, a .NET-based component library, and are delivered using standard C# and WPF components. The app allows users to add, modify, and design reports, and store them centrally in GPâ€™s company databases. Reports are available to users based on existing security privileges, and are viewable from web and desktop platforms. View images of the web windows [here](https://github.com/kswarthout/code_demos/blob/master/pc_web_reporting/README.md).
